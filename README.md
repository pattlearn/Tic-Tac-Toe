# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a "Tic-Tac-Toe" game. It's a simple project good to start learning ReactJS.

To start the project

```terminal
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
```

To run a project locally

```terminal
npm run dev
```

This project is a part on React official page to get start with React accessing via the link below https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

React feature using in this project is `useState`. This function is used to manipulate varible.

```js
(variable,setVariable) = useState(initialValue)
```

To use in another part of the code is to call `variable`. Initially the value of `variable` is `initialValue`. To assign new value of `newValue` to `variable` is to call `useState` under the parenthesis assign the `newValue` like `useState(newValue)`.
